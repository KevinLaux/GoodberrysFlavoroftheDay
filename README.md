# Goodberys Flavor of the Day
Fun Module that I am creating to parse the Flavor of the Day calendar from the Goodberry Ice Cream Website. https://www.goodberrys.com/flavor-of-the-day

You setup the free vision api [here]https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

You will need both a vision api app name and your api subscription key.

On first use you will need to run Set-FotDToken 'API Key' 'Vision App Name'

Then you can run Get-FotD to find out the current Flavor of the Day.
